# Maximum Spacing Clustering Algorithm

The objective of this project is to implement a clustering algorithm, called Maximum Spacing Clustering, using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

## Overview

Clustering (or clustering) is an unsupervised learning task that aims to find natural groups in databases. More specifically, the goal is to find groups of objects (e.g., people, cars, books, movies, music...) such that:
- Objects within the same group are "similar";
- Objects from different groups are not "similar".

## Features

- Implements the Maximum Spacing Clustering algorithm.
- Uses a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for clustering.
- Written in C
